# hw3-js-passwordgen-sajal

## Description
I added the option for the generator to generate upper and lower case letters for the password.

I added the option to choose if the user wants lowercase letters. I also added the numbers and special symbols characters. Added while loop to generatePassword function.

Added full list of each character type. 

Added alerts that require user to enter a valid number as well as a valid length between 8 and 128. Also required user to slect at least one of the character options for their password.

Rearranged the code and made it display message straight away for user to input a valid number or length instead of making them choose different character types first.

Made it so that when the user clicks the cancel button, it doesn't prompt them to enter a valid number. Also touched up some of the CSS elements.

Removed extra copy of JS file.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
